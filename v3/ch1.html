<p>This book is about HTML5 Programming. Before you can understand HTML5 programming, however, you need to take a step back and understand what HTML5 is, a bit of the history behind it, and the differences between HTML 4 and HTML5.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we get right to the practical questions to which everyone wants answers. Why HTML5, and why all the excitement just now? What are the new design principles that make HTML5 truly revolutionary—but also highly accommodating? What are the implications of a plugin-free paradigm; what’s in and what’s out? What’s new in HTML, and how does this kick off a whole new era for web developers? Let’s get to it.</p>

<h2>The Story So Far—The History of HTML5</h2>

<p>HTML goes back a long way. It was first published as an Internet draft in 1993. The ’90s saw an enormous amount of activity around HTML, with version 2.0, versions 3.2, and 4.0 (in the same year!), and finally, in 1999, version 4.01. In the course of its development, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) assumed control of the specification.</p>

<p>After the rapid delivery of these four versions though, HTML was widely considered a dead-end; the focus of web standards shifted to XML and XHTML, and HTML was put on the back burner. In the meantime, HTML refused to die, and the majority of content on the web continued to be served as HTML. To enable new web applications and address HTML’s shortcomings, new features and specifications were needed for HTML.</p>

<p>Wanting to take the web platform to a new level, a small group of people started the Web Hypertext Application Working Group (WHATWG) in 2004. They created the HTML5 specification. They also began working on new features specifically geared to web applications—the area they felt was most lacking. It was around this time that the term Web 2.0 was coined. And it really was like a second new web, as static web sites gave way to more dynamic and social sites that required more features—a lot more features.</p>

<p>The W3C became involved with HTML again in 2006 and published the first working draft for HTML5 in 2008, and the XHTML 2 working group stopped in 2009. Another two years passed, and that is where we stand today. Because HTML5 solves very practical problems (as you will see later), browser vendors are feverishly implementing its new features, even though the specification has not been completely locked down. Experimentation by the browsers feeds back into and improves the specification. HTML5 is rapidly evolving to address real and practical improvements to the web platform.</p>

<p>There's a lot more to this chapter, but we aren't loading it  just yet. Let's focus on Chapter 2 first.</p>
