<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<h1 id="usingthecanvasapi">Overview of HTML5</h1>


<p>This book is about HTML5 Programming. Before you can understand HTML5 programming, however, you need to take a step back and understand what HTML5 is, a bit of the history behind it, and the differences between HTML 4 and HTML5.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we get right to the practical questions to which everyone wants answers. Why HTML5, and why all the excitement just now? What are the new design principles that make HTML5 truly revolutionary—but also highly accommodating? What are the implications of a plugin-free paradigm; what’s in and what’s out? What’s new in HTML, and how does this kick off a whole new era for web developers? Let’s get to it.</p>

<p>There's a lot more to this chapter, but we aren't loading it  just yet. Let's focus on Chapter 2 first.</p>
