# Seasons, a boilerplate for Treesaver
## [live version of the latest build](http://lab.scottkellum.com/seasons/)

Since [Treesaver](https://github.com/Treesaver/treesaver) has been launched one of the most frequently asked questions has been “do you have a boilerplate or basic template?” The answer is yes, we have always had a bare-bones walkthrough but in-house we have been using something much more evolved. With a good boilerplate to kickstart projects, this  complex framework can be fully realized.

[Seasons](https://github.com/scottkellum/Seasons), the boilerplate we have built up and used in house for over a year  is now available as a starting point. We hope this will open the doors  to get started creating dynamic HTML publications with ease, and to enable integration of Treesaver publications in content management systems.

[Treesaver](http://treesaver.net) will still be producing high quality templates, both custom and off-the-shelf. With this documentation our clients can better understand and use the platform.

We are happy to launch Seasons, and eager to see what you do with it.

# Seasons 0.9.3.beta16
### A style framework for your Treesaver publication.

### This is BETA software containing a beta version of Treesaver.js. Formatting is subject to change.

### Modular-scale, color-schemer, and flexbox were removed in this release. Please add those to your project as needed from their individual repositories.

Seasons is a boilerplate for [Treesaver](http://treesaverjs.com/), a JavaScript layout engine. While Treesaver is an awesome bit of code it takes quite a bit of tinkering to get something up and running. This project aims to do the heavy lifting for you so you can get on with designing and building your project, not just tinkering until it works.

## Whats included?
Three different frameworks: CSS, Sass, and Compass. Pick your preference and get started with the bundled HTML project.
