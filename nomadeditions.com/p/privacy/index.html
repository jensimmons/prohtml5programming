<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Welcome to Nomad Editions, LLC (the "Company", "we" or "us"). We operate this website (the "Site") and other publication websites (collectively, the "Sites"). We are strongly committed to protecting the privacy of your information and providing a safe and secure environment for you, our users.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we provide you this privacy policy (the "Policy") to help you understand the kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit the Sites, how we may use and disclose the information, and how you can control, correct and/or update the information.</p>
<p>To be clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase "Personal Information" in this Policy, we mean information about you that is personally identifiable, like your name, address, e-mail address, or phone number, as well as other non-public information that is associated with this personal information. When we use the phrase "Anonymous Information" in this Policy, we mean information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information. Anonymous Information does not enable identification of or contact with individual persons.</p>
<p>By visiting this Site, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Policy. Each time you visit the Site, you agree and expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide as described in this Policy.</p>
<p>Your Personal Information is being processed and maintained by us in the United States where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.</p>
<p>This Policy applies to all Sites that are operated by the Company. In addition to this general policy, each Site may have additional privacy provisions that are specific to the particular site. These supplemental disclosures are made in the Site-specific addenda below or in a disclosure made at the time we collect the information. These supplemental disclosures also govern the use of your information.</p>
<h6>The Information We Gather</h6>
<p>We collect information about you in three ways:</p>
<p><strong>Information you voluntarily provide us.</strong> We collect and maintain information that you voluntarily submit to us during your use of the Sites. For example:</p>

<p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may stop you from gaining access to a Site. For more information on the types of information we collect, please see the How We Use Your Information section below.</p>
<p><strong>Information we collect through your use of the Site.</strong> As you use the Site, certain information may also be passively collected.

By knowing about you, we can deliver more helpful information, programs, tools and advertisements. Please see the sections below: Cookies, Web Beacons, and Log Information for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Information we receive from third parties.</strong> In addition to the information that you provide or we collect on the Site or through the Services, we may verify or collect certain information about you from third parties. For example, we may use your e-mail address to determine your street address or we may use your street address to obtain demographic information about you or the 9-digit ZIP code (ZIP+4) in which you live. This information may include household income, presence and age(s) of children, and other census data. We may combine this third-party information with the information we have already collected from you via our Sites. We protect and use this third-party information in the same way that we treat other information &ndash; in conformance with this Policy.</p>
