	Exploring the deep roots of Monterey’s famed Pisoni Vineyards</h2><h3 class="writer" itemprop="writer">

	While many winemakers and grape growers display a passion for their vocation, not all of them have bet the ranch — literally — to pursue their dream, the way that Gary Pisoni did. Today, the wines that emerge from his vineyards in the Santa Lucia Highlands of Monterey County read like a roster of California’s highest-rated pinot noirs. Siduri, Capiaux, Peter Michael, Patz &amp; Hall and ROAR wineries all buy Pisoni grapes and typically rack up scores in the 90s from Robert Parker and others for the layers they deliver of exotic dark red and black fruit, Indian spices, licorice and forest floor nuances. These are wines that sell for $50 a bottle or more, and are bought by men and women who identify Pisoni Vineyards with a lush, rounded yet elegantly finessed expression of the pinot grape.</p><p>
	But where the vines sway now in afternoon breezes from the nearby Pacific, romaine leaves once fluttered in the wind. For three generations the Pisonis had been lettuce farmers in the Salinas Valley, legendary land of Steinbeckian agriculture and angst, and it seemed as though that would continue. But Pisoni’s produce-farming parents made the mistake of allowing their son to thumb his way through France after he graduated from San Jose State and before he settled back down behind a plough.</p><p>
	Many a parent worries what might befall an itinerant son or daughter on a post-collegiate oats-sowing tour of Europe, but few would have predicted the transformational agricultural impact Pisoni’s sojourn made on him in 1982. Smitten by the lifestyle of the French <em>vignerons</em>, he lingered in Burgundy captivated by the charms of ancient châteaus surrounded by hill-terraced vineyards. Eventually he was commanded by his Dad to “hurry up and get your ass back here!”</p><p>
	Returning to the land of romaine, broccoli, asparagus, cattle and dairy cows, he had one all-consuming vision. “I want to plant vineyards,” he told his parents, showing them the pinot noir rootstock he’d smuggled home. Looking back now, he reflects: “It was in my blood. I wasn’t happy growing celery and lettuce!”</p><h4 class="keepwithnext">
	From cattle ranch to vineyard</h4><p class="first">
	Recognizing the potential for grapevines to return a far greater investment than row crops or cattle grazing, Pisoni had to convince his parents that planting vines was the key to the future. Putting the economics into perspective was difficult, as the sheer labor and materials involved in vineyard installation were at that time just beginning to be understood. His father, Eddie, was unimpressed, even when Pisoni explained that pinot noir was the most sought-after wine in the world.</p><p>
	“Dad,” said Pisoni, “Have you ever been to a $250 per person lettuce tasting? We should plant vines. Trust me, this is what we need to do.”</p><p>
	Encouraged by his wife Jane, Eddie finally allowed Pisoni to turn two of the 350 acres he owned in the Highlands, purchased in 1979, from cattle ranch into vineyards. That proved no small feat, especially in a low rainfall area. Pisoni admits he began to have his doubts, especially after the first and second wells went bust. He got tired of hauling water by truck, but he had no choice. He had to keep those precious suitcase clones of pinot alive.</p><p>
	“The first two wells were dry. I waited two years, tried again and got a little. Waited two more years. Tried again. Dry.” Finally, in 1990, after about $30,000 worth of drilling and six attempts, he finally struck water. Meanwhile, he’d also begun selling fruit to a handful of wineries, including Franciscan, and by the mid-90s, Pisoni was feverishly pitching the likes of Peter Michael, Siduri, Testarossa and Patz &amp; Hall, in hopes of getting a good score to put him on the map. Finally, in 1996, recognition came from Robert Parker for an Ojai Pisoni Vineyard wine, and Pisoni capitalized on that by writing letters to winemakers, urging them to come see what great grapes they were growing in this special place. The PR campaign, combined with his outsize personality, crushing handshake and bodacious wines, worked wonders.</p><p>
	Soon others, including Gary Franscioni, began planting pinot and chardonnay in The Highlands. Franscioni and Pisoni teamed up to create the famed Garys’ Vineyard, and are now selling to 18 different wineries. “I like to think of it as an all-star team,” says Pisoni. &nbsp;“We all work together. It’s unbelievable. Our own back yard is one the most amazing winegrowing regions in the world.”</p><h4 class="keepwithnext">
	Crops don’t lie</h4><p class="first">
	Pisoni’s mom, Jane, admits that when her son declared his intent to forgo cattle for grapes she was surprised. She hoped the new project would allow father and son to work together more harmoniously, as they were constantly butting heads over farming.</p><p>
	But crops don’t lie, and the first harvest, five years after planting, let Eddie know they were growing something of value, and something valuable as well. He quickly became a supporter. “It was a done deal then!” Muses Pisoni, “Yeah, somewhere in the mid-90s my Dad says to me, ‘Good thing we did it!’ I laughed, as he was fighting me all along the way!”</p><p>
	At that point, says Jane, “the ranch went from a fun place to a business. It turned into something great for the grandchildren, and I hope the great grandchildren will stay with it and pass on the joy to their children some day.”</p><p>
	Jane enjoys being involved in the business and still handles the finances. “I used to work at a bank, so I guess I like money and writing checks!” she says.</p><p>
	&nbsp;She invests heavily in her family as well: Every day she picks up the mail at the post office in her hometown of Gonzales, delivering it to son Gary and then to grandson, Mark, who lives with his wife Quinn (both are University of California at Davis grads), and their two children on the vegetable farm originally owned by Jane’s family. Mark still farms acres of broccoli, asparagus, cauliflower and romaine, in addition to the 130 acres of grapes he manages in the Highlands.</p><p>
	Pisoni’s other son, Jeff, makes the wine. What’s it like working together as a family? “My Dad is like a big kid. He always reminds us not to take things too seriously: he has an artsy and creative side,” says Mark. “He has three rules for customers: 1. Be our friend. 2. Make great wine. 3. Pay your bills. My style is very different. I’m disciplined and detail-oriented. I analyze and scrutinize. Jeff is a combination of both: He has fun, but he’s very serious about the wine.”</p><p>
	Says Jeff, a graduate of Fresno State, “Dad would say he made some great wine, but less consistent. I’ve been making wines for 10 years now and I think I’m making some serious wines, with my style moving from rustic to refined. I’m using all the tools to find a balance between size and elegance. I’m looking for more purity, more focus.”</p><p>
	Jane Pisoni shares a story that helps put Pisoni’s winemaking style into perspective. “When Gary was about 3 or 4, he was out playing in the yard, when suddenly he came rushing through the front door with a garden hose at full blast, eager to share something he wanted to say. That’s Gary. Spontaneous and unpredictable!”</p><p>
	Not everyone is a fan of the big, fire hose style of wines that characterize the&nbsp;Pisoni&nbsp;label, which can be immense, obsidian dark and a bit hard to carve into.&nbsp;Wine critic and syndicated columnist Dan Berger is pretty candid about his impressions of&nbsp;Pisoni&nbsp;wines, although he hasn’t tasted past the ’06 vintage.</p><p>
	“Somebody is not working hard enough at getting the fruit off the vine two days sooner,” he says. “The alcohols are sticking out — they are way up there. There are some gorgeous aromatics, but you have to fight through the alcohol to get to the fruit. You think, ‘Do I have to put this in my mouth?’ Once you do, you realize the fruit is there, just masked by the intensity of the alcohol. I’m guessing they’re letting it hang for better color and better intensity. The fruit on the vine is exceptional: You can taste there’s a great vineyard behind these wines. I just think that the wines would be so much more refined if they just picked sooner.”</p><p>
	After tasting a range of Pisoni vineyard designates from five different producers, it's clear that enormity of structure and an edgy, lurking sense of power run through them all, from the oak-intense treatments of Paul Lato to the elegant, nuanced wines of Gary Franscioni (Roar). I found the later vintages under the Pisoni label, articulated by Jeff beginning with 2007, moving away from the ebullient, steroidal teenager of prior releases. They display a more confident, mature tone that balances the inherent strength of this unique site, a place Franscioni calls “America's <em>grand cru</em> pinot vineyard.”</p><h4 class="keepwithnext">
	Battling the weather</h4><p class="first">
	Pisoni’s production of wines under their own labels Pisoni&nbsp;and Lucia is very small: They make fewer than 3,000 cases and sell about 70 percent of their estate fruit. The&nbsp;Lucia label is essentially a snapshot of the three vineyards Mark farms:&nbsp;Pisoni&nbsp;Estate, nearby Santa Lucia Sobranes and Garys’. The direct-mail list has been filled for years.</p><p>
	Of course you can’t afford to run a vineyard operation as large as theirs (130 total acres, with 40 at Pisoni, 50 at Garys’ and 38 at Sobranes) plus a full-on winery production facility if you don’t have some outside-the-family clients. Jeff is also making pinot and chard for Fort Ross vineyards, a 45-acre parcel on the extreme, fog-influenced Sonoma Coast. Dealing with two vastly different growing regions is helping him make more informed decisions in the vineyard and the cellar.</p><p>
	“The Santa Lucia Highlands is a small, somewhat new appellation, and so we’re still learning about what we have,” says Jeff, noting that clonal selection and controlling harvest with irrigation are focal points for 2012 as the Pisonis seek to limit fruit exposure to the elements. Marine influences are an asset and a detriment, both. Cooling winds extend the growing season and produce more character in the fruit; prolonged marine moisture causes mildewing. In a normal season there’s enough heat to prevent mildew but no weather these days can be considered normal. Late rains last summer caused bunch rot to set in before ripeness. Crews handpicked night and day to limit damage.</p><p>
	Pisoni’s son Mark looks back at 30 years of family history and says, “Each generation has had an impact on the land: a generational stamp. My grandfather was into cattle and vegetables. My Dad added grapes. I’m caretaking both. Jeff and I are now fine-tuning our approach in the vineyards, adopting sustainable and organic practices, using fewer chemicals and synthetic fertilizers. We’re taking the long-term view: We’re building this business for future generations.”</p><p class="last">
	For Pisoni, farming is life, whether it’s broccoli or pinot. “Every day, I enjoy the fruits of all my labors, and I get to share it with my family and friends. Is there anything better than that?” Thirty years from now, Mark’s son, Davis, now three, may well be fulfilling the dreams of his father, grandfather and great grandmother by saying the same thing as he too rides out at dawn to visit his vines and taste the fruits of his labor.</p><h4 class="keepwithnext">
