	Last summer, on a wine tour of the Italian region where Barolo is made, I partied with nebbiolos by night and sipped arneis by day. I was in the province of Piedmont, which extends from the Mediterranean on the west to Lombardy on the east. <em>Piemonte</em> wines are best known as superior offerings of reds made from nebbiolo and Barbera grapes — legendary Barolo, Barbaresco and dolcetto being the stars. But the region’s white wines, like the cortese reviewed elsewhere in the issue by Patricia Thomson, or the arneis I came upon as I rambled through the area, are very much admired locally, as is the delicious moscato. Unfortunately, they are not taken nearly as seriously as the reds on the world stage.</p><p>
	Piedmont is all about raw red meat — particularly carpaccio, veal sliced razor thin — and truffles. The region’s ridge-grown, inky red tannic wine, just about black in the case of nebbiolo (“fog” in Italian), is meant to show off the food’s attributes just as a stand-up bass complements a jazz piano. Who was I to complain, even though I don’t eat meat and missed out on the carpaccio and several dozen other carnivore specialties? I was a guest of the Dogliani family at their five-star resort Il Boscareto in the hills of Serralunga D’Alba and was treated to five-hour dinners every night replete with delicious customized vegetarian dishes, an entire opera of intriguing entrees, with which I happily drank the family’s red wines. (The resort alone is worth a vacation in Piedmont, where few tourists crowd the cobble streets.)</p><p>
	Still, I wanted to explore the region’s mineral and apricot-scented white arneis. As I traveled the hills of Piedmont by day and stopped for simple lunches, I noticed that this wine magically reinforced the flavors of the pasta and other dishes we were served. The white is mostly grown in neighboring Roero, north of Alba, and is just beginning to become trendy.</p><p>
	The name describes the grape. <em>Arneis</em> is Italian patois meaning “little rascal,” a nod to the difficulty of growing it on the vine. Full-bodied and floral, until recently it was grown mostly to blend into Barolo as a softening agent, to domesticate the tough tannins of the thick-skinned nebbiolo grape and maybe help bring it around sooner than the fifteen years of cellaring it often requires. Today, as tastes change, arneis is more than ready for its own close-up and it is being planted in other parts of world: the Santa Ynez Valley of California’s Central Coast, New Zealand and around Adelaide in South Australia.</p><p>
	I tasted two well-regarded imports with Italian winemaker Frederico Spagnalia; the usual <em>Uncorked</em> blind-tasters were off performing other tasks in other locales. Both blind-tasted wines were tasted again 24 hours later in order to re-evaluate first impressions.</p><h4 class="keepwithnext">
	Cult Favorite</h4><h5 class="keepwithnext">
	Bruno Giacosa 2009 Roero Arneis, 12.5% alc., $29</h5><p class="first">
	We both noticed immediately that this wine radiated white flowers, a hint of jasmine and that it gave off waves of summer fruit scents. “<em>Pesca! Pesca!</em>” Spagnalia exclaimed. “Peach! Peach!” In the mouth it also delivered loads of succulent, ripe apricot and nectarine flavors, all supported by tangy acid. I noted green apple as well, as in a grüner veltliner, and Spagnalia paid special attention to the way the wine lingered; it had a slightly bitter but enjoyable finish, he said, and I agreed. We both knew that Giacosa, a noble winery, has been going through tough times recently, due to the health issues of its key players, so it was a fine surprise to learn, when the covering bags were removed, that Giacosa is stlil producing a deliciously fleshy, lightly tropical white with almond and apricot notes — and a superb food wine as well.</p><h4 class="keepwithnext">
	Cash Favorite</h4><h5 class="keepwithnext">
	Cascina Chicco 2009 Roero Arneis Anterisio, 13% alc., $19</h5><p class="first last">
	Located on a beautiful hillside in Piedmont, like many other wineries in that province, Cascina Chicco is known as a top producer of arneis. Their white is prized for its perfumed bouquet, for its delicacy and for slowly revealing unexpected aromas and layers of flavor as the wine warms slightly in the glass. This is a wine and a winery worth seeking out, but be warned: imports to the US are limited. Once again ripe peaches, baked lemon desserts and tropical fruits dominate in this arneis, substantially more complex and rewarding than many sauvignon blancs and almost all of the pinot grigios both of us had tasted recently. “If I’m an apricot I bathe in this wine,” said Spagnalia. I know exactly what he meant although I’m not sure I can fully explain the insight. The Chicco is juicy, sunny, and bottled <em>joie de vivre</em> in any language.<br/>
	<br/>
	<strong>Verdict:</strong> This is one of the very few times in Cult Vs. Cash where we just couldn’t decided on a winner, so we called a draw. In fact, we invited a few friends over to taste both wines in an attempt to name a victor, and everyone agreed that we had no business trying to choose a winner here. The takeaway? As warm weather approaches, arneis is a wine you should plan to explore and enjoy.</p><!-- Not published image "  images 2012 04 32522-uccvc.toc.jpg" --><!-- Published image "  images 2012 04 32862-uc16-cvc-arneis-1.jpg" --><figure class="zoomable"><div data-minHeight="421" data-sizes="mobile-3x4" data-minWidth="280"><img width="280" data-src="img/_images-uncorked/2012/04/32862-uc16-cvc-arneis-1-jpg/32862-uc16-cvc-arneis-1-jpg_mobile-3x4.jpg" height="373"/><p class="caption">
