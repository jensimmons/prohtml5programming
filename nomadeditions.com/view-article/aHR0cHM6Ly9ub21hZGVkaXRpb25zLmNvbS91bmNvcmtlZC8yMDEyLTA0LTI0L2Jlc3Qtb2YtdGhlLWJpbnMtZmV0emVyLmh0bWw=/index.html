	As a companion piece to our feature on Gary Pisoni and his family of Monterey winemakers, we tasted two excellent releases — among many — from another venerable California wine family, the Fetzers. Barney Fetzer, who died in 1981, was a pioneer vineyard planter and winemaker in Mendocino. A lumberman by trade, he dreamed of owning his own winery in Redwood Valley, and began by buying 750 acres with his wife, Kathleen, in 1957. Meanwhile the couple was raising 11 children. Eventually the Fetzers opened a small tasting room in Hopland and expanded the operation to become California’s first midsized sustainable and organic winery. In 1992 Fetzer was purchased by the Brown-Forman Corporation, which pledged to honor the couple’s commitment to eco-friendly growing methods — banning toxic herbicides and pesticides in the vineyards, as well as synthetics. Today 20 percent of all the organic vineyards in California belong to Fetzer. It also buys 100 percent green power. Fetzer’s Bonterra has become the number-one selling brand of wines in the US made with organic grapes. (Last winter Brown-Forman sold Fetzer to Chile’s Concha Y Toro, which produces 28 million cases of wine annually. The brothers who own Concha have vowed to renovate the lagging Fetzer brand.)</p><p>
	Equally committed to organic growing methods, several of Barney and Kathleen Fetzer’s children have developed their own wineries. Jim Fetzer and his daughter Katrina run Ceago Vinegarden on the north shore of Clear Lake in nearby Lake County, Calif., where they farm biodynamically. The spectacular Ceago property is worth a special excursion.</p><p>
	By looks and demeanor Jim’s younger sister, Patti, owner of Patianna Organic Vineyards in Hopland, might have stepped out of a Lady Antebellum country song, but anyone dealing with her as a winery owner quickly gets that the teased hair, cowgirl attire and country-strong persona mask a keen business mind. No stranger to personal tragedy — her first husband died two years after they founded Patianna in 2003, and a brother, Bobby, died a year later in a fatal rafting accident — Patti has proved to be resilient and as equally committed to the preserving the environment as her parents. “My mother taught us to put things back better than we found them,” she writes on the Patianna website. “Mother Nature deserves the same.”</p><h5 class="keepwithnext">
	Patianna 2010 Sauvignon Blanc, 14.2% alc., $17</h5><p class="first">
	Loads of melon flesh out this tangy, acidic SB, but what is most striking and remarkable about this wine, and all other Patianna wines — is their pure fruit vibrancy. The debate about whether ultra-organic grape-growing practices make any difference in the taste of the wine may well go on forever, or Patianna wines could end it in a blind tasting. The SB, syrah and chardonnay come across as luscious, fruity, never complexly layered but invariably pure and delicately balanced. They present the essence of fruit-based wine flavors. In time they develop nuance but they initially can be distinguished by the fullness of their berry, melon, herbal and stone fruit qualities. The 2010 sauvignon blanc, with a mineral touch, too, is a case in point. It stands as the perfect warm-weather picnic companion and based on past experience with Patianna wines, it will gain from maturity with up to three years of aging.</p><h5 class="keepwithnext">
	Masút 2010, Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir, 14.3% alc., $40</h5><p class="first">
	Fetzer brothers Jake and Ben Fetzer, have dedicated Masút Vineyard and Winery to the memory of their dad, Bobby. Located on the headwaters west of the Russian River in Redwood Valley, Mendocino, Camp Masút was once was home to a tribe of Pomo Indians and has been in the Fetzer family for three generations. (<em>Masút</em> translates to “dark, rich earth.”) Bobby expanded the vineyard and took a gamble in growing pinot noir in a terrain best suited to zinfandel. He chose a hillside exposed to ocean breezes, and protected from the hot summer sun that can bake pinot noir clusters while caressing a zin or merlot grapes. Here, too, the commitment was to organic practices, sustainable farming, and land preservation.</p><p>
	Jake and Ben’s first release in 2009, from plantings a decade earlier, struck me as pinot noir with too much attitude. It was bold, aggressive, none too subtle and all too brash. But I put away a bottle for a year and when I drank it with wine-savvy friends, it needed no apologies. Cellaring does wonders for biodynamic reds, I’ve discovered, and the Masút proved to be prime evidence. The 2010 is less assertive but still needs to stretch out and relax. Its lush round ripeness and mocha pinot concentrated flavors are all focused and well balanced with firm tannic grip underlying the components. This integrated, quite delicious and sexy pinot is barrel fermented and <em>sur lies</em> — left in contact with yeast cells — for six months to soften its edges and develop its velvety mouthfeel.</p><p class="last">
	My suggestion: Buy a case, take a world tour, come back in two years and drink. It’s a forest floor Burgundian style pinot with a delightful American cranberry pie accent.</p><!-- Published image "  images 2012 04 32758-uc16-botb-pinot-noir.jpg" --><figure class="zoomable"><div data-minHeight="258" data-sizes="mobile-4x3" data-minWidth="280"><img width="280" data-src="img/_images-uncorked/2012/04/32758-uc16-botb-pinot-noir-jpg/32758-uc16-botb-pinot-noir-jpg_mobile-4x3.jpg" height="210"/><p class="caption">
