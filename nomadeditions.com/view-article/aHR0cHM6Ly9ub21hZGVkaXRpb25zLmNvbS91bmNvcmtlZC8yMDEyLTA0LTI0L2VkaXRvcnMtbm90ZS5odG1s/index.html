	Wine producers, at least those in California, fall into two primary categories. The wealthiest, with few exceptions like Franzia and Gallo, sure as hell haven’t amassed their fortunes making wine. Too sane and too savvy to trust grape clusters as the foundation for living large, they toiled elsewhere, often in finance, sometimes in tech and medicine and real estate and so on, and then took a chunk of their fortune and turned it into the grand edifices that line the Silverado Trail in Napa and to a lesser extent, Route 12 in Sonoma Valley.</p><p>
	These marble, brass and mahogany estates, with their refined rustic accent, pay tribute to the self worth and high ambition of their owners, and many produce excellent wines from proprietary grapes. What they lack is a sense of historical presence: Their owners are rarely local or connected through family to the settlers of the area. There’s splendor yes, but frequently a hollow core. This is money talking, you say to yourself as you tour the lavish tasting and barrel rooms; it spreads out in all directions but sprang from no indigenous roots and sprouts no roots of its own.</p><p>
	The other group of producers didn’t start out planting and growing grapes to make wine — except, perhaps in the basement of their homes. These were the gritty lettuce, tomato and zucchini farmers, many of them Italian, who grew produce and planted prune and apple orchards, sweated out their livelihoods and learned by trial and error. Over the past three or four decades those orchards and plowed fields have given way to vineyards, often owned today by the same families.</p><p>
	Numbers tell the story: If Gravenstein apples go for $300 a ton in the Russian River Valley, and pinot noir fruit goes for $3,500 a ton, there’s not much argument about which you’ll plant. Not now, perhaps, but there were all sorts of farming family squabbles about converting to vineyards in the ’70s and ’80s. Wine grapes in many areas were an unproven commodity. Until Warren Dutton took the gamble in 1975, for instance, and put in a pinot noir and chardonnay vineyard in the Russian River region, everyone was convinced the valley was just too foggy and too cold to grow wine grapes.</p><p>
	About 150 miles south in Monterey County, a similar scenario unfolded. Would you plow under a sure crop of romaine to take a flyer, at great cost, on fermented grape juice? No, said old-time Santa Lucia Highlands farmer Eddie Pisoni. among many others. Yes, said his rambunctious, strong-willed son, Gary. The two butted heads so often their ears rang.</p><p>
	Who won? If you’re a pinot noir aficionado, you already know. But you may not know the backstory; you will if you read Laura Ness’ profile of the Pisonis, past and present, in this week’s feature. Elsewhere in the issue, Pat Thomson passes along her intimate knowledge of Gavi in Vino Italiano, and we run down the highest-rated Sauternes in “Big Score Pours.”</p><p>
	And don’t miss next week’s issue: We’ve paired up with the wine website Snooth and will devote the entire issue to chardonnay, the first of our monthly Buyers’ Guides. Until then, <em>salut!</em></p><p>
