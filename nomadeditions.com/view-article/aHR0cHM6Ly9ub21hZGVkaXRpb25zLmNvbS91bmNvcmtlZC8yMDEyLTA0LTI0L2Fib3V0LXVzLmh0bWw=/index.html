		Uncorked
	
		Stephen Yafa
	
		Editor Stephen Yafa (“Cult vs. Cash” and “Best of the Bins”) gets to do many of things that make life interesting — at least for him. When not editing and writing for <em>Uncorked</em>, he plays guitar, writes music, makes pinot noir for his company, Segue Cellars in West Sonoma, Calif., writes an occasional book and listens to Gillian Welch and Tom Waits.
	
		Claudia A. Perry
	
		Claudia A. Perry (“This Week in Wine”), a four-time <em>Jeopardy!</em> champion and two-time tournament semifinalist, is a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and &nbsp;a member of the Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame Nominating Committee. She holds an advanced certificate from the Wine and Spirits Education Trust. Perry’s blog, chronicnegress.net, features her musings on wine, knitting, hockey and other life and death issues. A financial representative and health insurance broker for The Heartland Group, she resides in Evanston, Ill.
	
		Laura Ness
	
		Laura Ness (“Main Serving”), aka “Her VineNess,” is a wine journalist and educator who enjoys writing about wines with character and the characters who make them. She writes for many industry and consumer publications, including <em>Wine Business Monthly</em>, <em>Vineyard &amp; Winery Management</em>, <em>Wines &amp; Vines</em>, <em>Wine Country This Week</em> and <em>Vine Times</em>, and pens a weekly wine column for several newspapers. She blogs, unapologetically and often irreverently, at Myvinespace.com.
	
		Patricia Thomson
	
		Since her salad days as a budding Renaissance art historian in Florence, when she was seduced by sangiovese, freelance writer Patricia Thomson (“Vino Italiano”) has focused on Italian wine. In the decades since, she has married an Italian (with an enticing wine cellar), cofounded the wine tour company La Dolce Vita Wine Tours,&nbsp; and launched the blog Living La Dolce Vita. She has also been a contributing writer to <em>Tastes of Italia</em> magazine and now divides her time between brownstone Brooklyn and the medieval village of Varinella (pop. 252), one hill over from Gavi in Piedmont.
	
		Bill Gibron
	
		Bill Gibron’s (“Big Score Pours” and “Vino Video”) commentary on popular culture and current film can be found on such prestigious sites as American Movie Classics/Filmcritic.com and PopMatters.com. In addition, he edits content for the Short Ends and Leader Film Blog as well as other special features.
	
		James Suckling
	
		James Suckling ("Vino Video" producer), one of today’s leading wine critics, is&nbsp; currently the Wine Editor for <em>Asia Tatler</em>. He spent nearly 30 years as Senior Editor and European Bureau Chief of <em>The Wine Spectator</em>, and as European Editor of <em>Cigar Aficionado</em>. <em>Forbes</em> recently called the Los Angeles-born writer “one of the world’s most powerful wine critics.” In late 2010, Suckling launched JamesSuckling.com, a site that rates the best wines from around the world.
